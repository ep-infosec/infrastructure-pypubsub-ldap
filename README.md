# infrastructure-pypubsub-ldap
Apache Infrastructure PyPubSub LDAP Activity Extension

This is a simple pypubsub client that listens for any changes to our LDAP directory and broadcasts them via pypubsub.
It runs on our tools-vm as a pipservice.

PyPubSub itself can be found at: https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-pypubsub
